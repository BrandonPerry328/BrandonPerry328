Hi, Iâ€™m BrandonPerry! I'm currently a Software Engineering student at Brigham Young University - Idaho.
This is my personal GitHub where I post little projects that I do in my free time.
I worked with a team to create a 2D Platformer game using Unity and Visual Studio. I'm still working on uploading this one.
